## Project

Spindle Lab is a desktop laboratory app for prototyping and de-risking techniques before they land in [Spindle](https://github.com/liminal-hq/spindle), the DVD/Blu-ray authoring studio. Each "lab" is a self-contained experiment — a folder plus a registry entry — that proves or disproves a technique and writes up its findings. See `docs/plan.md` for the full v1 implementation plan and `SPEC.md` for what each shipped lab actually proved.

## Coding Standards

- **Spelling:** Must use Canadian spelling for things that don't require American spelling (e.g., UI strings, variables, comments). Examples: "colour", "center" -> "centre", "behavior" -> "behaviour".
- **Commit Messages:** Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add scanner`, `fix: typo in header`).

## Commit Messages

**Format:** Use Conventional Commits format (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `test: ...`).

- Use `test:` for test-related changes, including fixes to tests themselves (do not use `fix:` unless it fixes application code).

**Body Requirements:**

- Explain what and why (not how)
- Use markdown: **bold**, _italics_, `code`, bullet lists
- **NO markdown headings** - use **bold labels** for sections (not always required)
- When a commit body includes backticked code in shell commands, avoid command substitution by using single-quoted `-m` strings (preferred) or escaping backticks.
  - Example (preferred): `git commit -m 'fix: ...' -m 'Use `scanStatus` in footer'`
  - Example (escape): `git commit -m "Use \`scanStatus\` in footer"`

**Specific Updates**: Each commit message should reflect the specific changes made in that commit. Do not just recap the entire project history or scope. Focus on the now.

**Shell Interpolation Safety:**

- Do not pass markdown-heavy commit bodies directly via `git commit -m "..."` when they include backticks, `$()`, or shell-sensitive characters.
- Prefer writing the message to a file with a single-quoted heredoc and commit with `git commit -F <file>` to prevent shell expansion.
- If using `-m`, escape shell-sensitive characters explicitly before running the command.
- After committing, verify the stored message with `git log -1 --pretty=fuller` and amend immediately if interpolation altered content.

## Pull Request Titles

**Requirement:** PR titles must be human-readable summaries of the PR change.

- Start with a capital letter, write in the imperative mood, and keep to roughly one 70-character line.
- Do not use Conventional Commit prefixes in PR titles (for example, no `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
- Describe the outcome or behaviour change, not internal process language.
- Ignore internal planning document notes in PR titles and descriptions unless they directly map to repository changes.
- Keep title style consistent across every open PR in the same stack.
- If one title in a stack is updated, update the rest of the open stack titles to match style and scope.
- Do not rename merged PRs unless explicitly requested.
- Keep linked issues and merge order aligned after any title changes in a stack.

## Pull Request Content

**Requirement:** PR titles and descriptions must not mention internal workflow artefacts.

- Do not mention deferred-review documents, internal queue labels, or internal-only planning notes in outward PR content.
- Keep internal triage mechanics in local runbooks, internal labels, and agent workflows only.
- Use user-facing, outcome-focused language in PR titles and descriptions.
- Only include internal process details in PR content when explicitly requested by the user.
- Open pull requests ready for review by default. Only create a draft PR when the user explicitly asks for a draft or when there is a clearly communicated blocker that makes draft status necessary.

**PR Description Format:**

- Prefer a compact markdown structure with `## Summary` and `## Test plan`.
- Under `## Summary`, use `###` sub-sections when they help group the change cleanly.
- Under each summary section, use flat bullets with bold lead-ins for scanability.
- Keep the summary focused on outcomes and behaviour changes, not commit history or implementation chronology.
- Under `## Test plan`, use checklist bullets (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`) and include the concrete commands, validations, or remaining gaps.
- If something could not be verified, state that plainly at the end of `## Test plan` or immediately below it.

## Pull Request Labels

**Requirement:** Every PR must include labels that describe the change and map to release-note categories.

- Add at least one primary category label to every PR: `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, `testing`, `ci`, `build`, or `chore`.
- Add shared operational labels where they help clarify handling: `infrastructure`, `internal`, `release`, `blocked`, `epic`, or `skip-changelog`.
- Add product and subsystem scope labels where helpful: `frontend`, `backend`, `rust`, `tauri`, `desktop`, `developer-experience`, `performance`, `security`, `labs-shell`, `svg-lab`.
- Prefer the broader Liminal HQ label style over Conventional Commit terms for PR labelling. Use GitHub label categories like `enhancement` and `bug` instead of labels such as `feat` or `fix`.
- Use `skip-changelog` only when a change should be excluded from generated release notes.
- Keep labels accurate as scope changes during review.

## Git Workflow

**Requirement:** Do not push changes (especially force pushes) to the repository unless explicitly requested by the user.

- **Fix branch naming:** When creating a branch for a fix, use `fix/issue-<number>-<short-description>` (for example, `fix/issue-19-wsl2-deb-runtime`).
- **GitHub tooling:** Prefer the `gh` CLI for repository, pull request, label, review, and GitHub Actions work. Only use connector-style GitHub tooling when the user explicitly asks for it or when `gh` cannot complete the task cleanly.

## Local Tooling

- **Rust fallback:** If Rust tooling such as `cargo` is not available on the host, prefer using the locally available `ghcr.io/liminal-hq/tauri-dev-desktop:latest` image to run Rust and Tauri commands against the checked-out workspace.

## Documentation

- **Updates:** When user-facing behaviour, CLI options, or features change, update `README.md` and `SPEC.md`.
- **No hard wrapping:** Never hard-wrap paragraph prose in markdown files — write each paragraph or list item as a single line and let viewers soft-wrap. Deliberate short standalone lines, one-liners, and separate bullets are intentional structure — never collapse them.

## Licence and Copyright

- **Requirement:** New source files (and substantially rewritten source files) should include a short header as the first content in the file.
- **Applies to:** `.rs`, `.ts`, `.tsx` source files in `src/` directories.
- **Do not add headers to:** generated files, lockfiles, config files (`.json`, `.yml`, `.toml`), markdown docs, HTML mockups, or CSS files.

Preferred header format for Rust:

```rust
// Brief one-line summary of what this file does
//
// (c) Copyright 2026 Liminal HQ, Scott Morris
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

Preferred header format for TypeScript:

```typescript
// Brief one-line summary of what this file does
//
// (c) Copyright 2026 Liminal HQ, Scott Morris
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

- Keep the summary to one concise sentence.
- Place the header before `use`/`import` statements.
- Leave one blank line between the header and the first code line.
- Preserve existing valid licence headers when already present.

## Labs-specific conventions

- **A lab is a registry entry plus a folder.** Nothing else. `src/shell/registry.ts` is the one deliberate aggregation file in the repo — the "no barrel files" rule everywhere else still applies.
- **Labs never import from each other.** Each lab owns its own zustand store, its own Rust module under `src-tauri/src/labs/<id>/`, and its own CSS.
- **Rust command names are prefixed with the lab id** (e.g. `svg_import`, `svg_render_session_begin`) so the flat `generate_handler!` namespace stays legible; group them with a comment banner per lab.
- **No premature promotion.** A lab's Rust logic only moves out to `crates/lab-<id>/` once it exceeds roughly a thousand lines or needs its own dependency set — see `docs/labs-shell.md`. Do not build a Tauri-plugin split for a lab.
